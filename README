* The more you play the more trends will become apparent.


IMPROVE

Feel free to add your own quotes in quotes.py. Just make sure to use
a : to separate category and quote, and that the quote itself doesn't
contain any : characters. Rewrite the quote to - for instance - use
a ; instead. Or improve the quote parser (get_quote).


Good luck, have fun ;-)
